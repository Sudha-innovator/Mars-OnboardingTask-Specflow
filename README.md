Mars Project- Test Scripts in Selenium with Spec Flow framework

I have added the TestCases for the Language tab in Profile details for the SkillSwap website.
TestCase1 - Adding English language with Basic level to the language list
Test Case2 - Trying to add the duplicate record with language 'English', which is already existed in the list.
Test Case2- Trying to add 3 language record with Scenario Outline-Examples 
Test Case3 - Trying to edit the level from 'Basic' to 'Conversational' for the above added 'English' language
Test Case4 - Trying to add 5th language, which should n't allowed. We already had 4 records in the language list.
Test Case5 - Trying to delete the first record.
*Test Case6 - Tryig to add the duplicate record with case change(Upper/lower case letters) in the name of the language.
            - system is allowing to add - Its a defect - need to raise a defect
            - This has failed in Manual testing itself, so didn't create the automatio script.
